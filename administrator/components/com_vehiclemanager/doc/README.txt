01. INTRODUCTION

a vehicles with ease on a Joomla-based website.

Vehicle Review options, it is excellent for Vehicle shop management. 
It can be used to set up and manage shops, vehicle rentals, vehicle ehtusiast 
sites, brand sites, etc.

the Free version. For full details on the different options visit

02. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------

VehicleManager Pro is a Joomla component. It needs a functioning Joomla 1.5.x 
installation. VehicleManager Pro needs PHP 5 with CURL, XSL and GD extensions 
to function properly.

PLEASE CHECK BEFORE INSTALLING VehicleManage:
In order for csv export to work, you need to compile PHP5 with support for the 
XSL extension!
In order for CAPTCHA images (Guest User anti-spam for reviews and suggestions) 
to work, you need to compile PHP5 with the GD extension!

CHECK YOUR PHP INSTALLATION FOR PROPER EXTENSIONS:
First please make sure PHP5 has the above extensions enabled!
- If you run your own web server, please recompile PHP with support for XSL, 
  CURL and GD.
- If your website is with a hosting provider, check with them for the inclusion 
  of these PHP extensions.
VehicleManager needs these PHP extensions to install and function correctly!

INSTALLER CHECK FOR PHP EXTENSIONS:
The VehicleManager installer will check for the availability of these PHP extensions 
and issue a warning if they are missing. If you get such a warning, just uninstall 
VehicleManager, fix the PHP extensions first, and then reinstall VehicleManager.

PLEASE NOTE:
Even though we can do checks for the proper PHP extensions inside the VehicleManager 
installer package, we have no way to roll back the installation once started, not 
even when a check fails. So installation will continue, even if a PHP extension is 
not present. This is unfortunately a limitation of the Joomla installer!

-----------------------------

Modules and plugins (mambots) are constantly being developed for use with 
VehicleManager. You can download them from the download sections on the website.



10. LANGUAGES
-------------

VehicleManager Pro comes with English and Russian language files included.
The VehicleManager interface will automatically pick up the frontend or backend 
language set in your Joomla configuration. Frontend language switches with 
JoomFish will also result in the automatic language change in VehicleManager.

You can add non-included languages to VehicleManager by creating your own 
translations. 
Copy english.php from the directory /components/com_vehiclemanager/language/, 
rename it to your language and then create the translation. Next add the 
language selectors to the code and upload the translation to your VehicleManage.
You can find full instructions on creating translations and adding languages 
on the website.
Remember that Joomla 1.5.x needs files saved as UTF-8, so do NOT use Notepad or
Wordpad (they are not UTF-8 capable)!
